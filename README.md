# Authenticating_6LoWPAN_Contiki-NG

This repository contains 2 versions of a solution to authenticate 6LoWPAN-operating resource-cosntrained devices (Z1 motes) simulated on Contiki-NG's Cooja.

Note that in order to run the respective "*.csc" projects for any of the versions, make the warnings from the buildfile not act as errors by changing Contiki's build configuration to avoid warnings as errors.

There's also an excel file that includes the computer resource consumption that were used for consumption calculation of the device under a certain circumstance.
